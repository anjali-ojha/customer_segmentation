If the weather is nice do yourself a favor and sit outside.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |0     |TjD2S66AWxlKsPSQBR1t-Q|\n",

Our microwave was not functioning and James one by one walked through the possible issues. Finally we realized that it is a microwave problem rather than an electrical circuit issue. Nevertheless he set up a separate exclusive breaker for the microwave. The best part was that he charged as per his quote though it took slightly more time. The overall price was also much lower than other quotes we received. \\n\\nOne small area of improvement- If they could come come with a broom to do the cleanup :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |0     |Vtfxxq3nxdYHRiH6OAV59g|\n",

I came in looking for the already cut fruit bowls but they had all been bought up. I asked the manager that happened to be walking if they had any left. He asked what type of fruit bowl I was looking for then he some freshly made up is 5 minutes. Like I said great customers services. Couldn't have asked for more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |0     |ir9ixBZPzBwWe9IZ_7qsYA|\n",

Location by the trail is nice and it's a nice place to hang out, inside or on the porch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |0     |SVtNqAQFwOca_3yr1PihCQ|\n",

Not many bells or whistles but it has a great whisky selection and a solid crew of bar tenders manning all 24 hours of day and night. Very dog and pup friendly. They've always got a treat for the furry friend and don't be surprised if the pup gets served before you do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |0     |pMj9HULhkLzg2qqclC5wuw|\n",

When the younger people are working they are constantly on their phones and not busting tables or running food and drinks. Also had to wait for a very long time for someone to come to the register. Needs better management for sure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |0     |LVGZiLxiJe3VsUpaUyzXqw|\n",

The perfect time for me to head over and not rush.\\n\\nI noticed they had the Ms.Vickis bbq chips, so I ended up getting the meal.\\n\\nOnly had to wait about 5 min., and was ready to head back home.\\n\\nSandwiches are great value for the size, and the bread was nice and soft. The combo of the mushrooms, melted cheese, and sweet peppers were great flavors mixed with the steak. Just the ends of my sandwich were empty, so no 5 stars ..\\n\\nWill definitely be trying other sandwiches in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |11    |R9IJ1Byr27n6wXj3QvJ2Lg|\n",

The museum has included many immersive experiences, such as life on the home front, USA's war production capabilities, etc.  History buffs will notice the minute details are missing (such as how Japanese hubris about taking Pearl Harbor (leaving intact the oil fields for future use), was a significant mistake that contributed to their loss at the battle of Midway). Regardless, the museum has something for every learning style.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |1     |7JiwGIYyr8W4xguSsIi1sQ|\n",

It crushes Kraftwork. Brendan really knows how to select his beers. Never redundant, always accessible, while still being adventurous. Two beer engines, to boot. This place is really about beer. There are several stand-out choices on the menu too. My favorites include the Port Richmond platter, chicken fried chicken, and beer-battered pickles. Bartenders and staff are awesome--and management treats the employees very well.\\n\\nThe beer can be expensive, which is understandable for the rare beers Memphis offers. However, not publishing prices is less understandable, as is not swallowing the liquor tax at the bar. Not being able to drink in the dining room during slow hours is also an irritant (but understandable during peak hours, too).\\n\\nUpdated on Jan. 24, 2013: Added one star because, literally, it's the best bar in Fishtown and needs that distinction from the others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |1     |FUUEU3ZN5cL1nNNR2AYZuw|\n",

All she wanted was a couple of birthstone's put on it and resized, well about 2 week's ago she finally got it back only to find out that it wasn't resized, she brought it back to have him finish what he was suppose to. After a couple day's she got the ring back only to have one of the stone's fall out with in hour's of getting it back. We called Todd and told him about it, he said that he would redo it. After another week or so went by and my wife got her ring back again only to once again have the same stone fall out again with in hour's of putting it back on her finger. We called Todd again and after all that he started blaming my wife for the stone falling out, granted she only had it on for a couple hour's. He told me that he personally checked this himself and that everything was ok and that it had to be the way she was wearing it. WHAT?? Wearing it,she hasn't even wore more than a couple hour's what could she possibly be doing wrong? Well that night after I got off the phone with Todd I myself went and looked at the ring checking the other stone that he put in,the other one was moving when I put my finger nail up against it and he said that he double checked this yeah right. So it has now been another week and a half or so and then we get a call from Todd telling me that the Ruby was on back order and that it would not be done when he said it was going to be. Not to mention that you have to sit there and listen to his nagging complaint's about his back, his chest and every other reason as to why he can't get a simple ring job done. So to make this short this ring was suppose to be a mother's day gift and Todd still has the ring to this day, he has been paid in full and refuses to give us a refund.We took the ring to a different jewelry store prior to bringing it back to him and they said the work that was done on the ring was cheap and that the stone's will continue to fall out the way that he had them set in the setting. Not to mention that the aqua marine stone that cost us 150.00 $ at Todd's store was only 35.00$ at the other jewelry store. At this point the price difference doesn't make me has mad as Todd having the ring longer than my wife has had it. I can't comment on the jewelry that he has for sale, it look's nice but you have been warned go some where else it's noty worth the headache's trust me. I can only hope that that she'll get her ring back on her finger shortly.. Total time the ring has been gone for now is pushing 7 week's, oh yeah if it fall's out again I'll be taking it some where else and probably be taking Todd some where as well..

As a frequent flyer this place had more fees than an airline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |4     |h1i7LY14_jjNcrxxkCD_mA|\n",

We love Indian food and we love Buffets so this review is for a weekday Buffet. $8.99!\\n\\nI'm posting pictures with some name tags because you know what you like. A previous review mentioned a lack of lamb...it's now included!\\n\\nThe variety is VERY good. The flavors are delicious. I must say this Chicken Tikka Masala is wonderful! And they have the best Dal we've ever had...the dark thick one, not the soup...although they have the soup also. \\n\\nI'm a huge Nan fan. This Nan is made FRESH and it is PERFECT...delicately crispy but still softly foldable. I had mostly stuffed it all in before I remembered to take a pic!  My idea of Indian fare is to forget the high glycemic white rice in favor of dipping my Nan into bowls of hot food deliciousness. If you are also a big Nan fan and know you want extra, consider telling your waiter when he seats you because it takes a while once you order! \\n\\nThis Royal India Buffet really shows its Royalty in the DESSERT choices. If you love Indian desserts you will LOVE THIS BUFFET. \\n\\nThe only item I pictured that is not included on the buffet is the fried cheese balls in honey syrup called Gulab Jamun (not really cheese). The photo I included is what I got AFTER I sent it back asking for LOTS of extra honey sauce! You gotta ask if it's the sauce you love. I've always had this from the hot steam table but because it's not on the buffet they served it cold. It was still delicious but I believe hot is even better! I paid an extra $2.99 for those 2 little balls  so I could review it. I'm glad I did because I might stop in just for dessert sometime. They are very good. But there are plenty of other yummies on the buffet so I wouldn't pay extra again at lunch time. \\n\\nThe Gajar Halwa, Carrott dessert,  is my all time favorite and it is hot in the buffet. But I also love Kheer, rice pudding with Tamarind Chutney stirred in!  Yes...I prefer my high glycemic non nutritious white rice to be laden with sugar and cream!\\n\\nThe big surprise was MANGO ICE CREAMYES it's included on the buffet!  And it is creamy deliciousness in a spoon!  Of course, because I love the sweet Tamarind sauce, I had to add a little to the mango ice cream...oh yeah...that's why they had to roll me out of here!\\n\\nService?  EXCELLENT...and we arrived @ 12:30 prime lunch time, yet everyone took time to be helpful. \\n\\nWe will be back HERE every time we need Indian food! It is worth driving a little further BEST IN TOWN                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |1     |xlvXh8mtQSi7rcMjAqXXtw|\n",

There sign out front says 10am to 6pm but I was informed by an employee out front they close the doors at 5:30 to any customers coming in but stay open until six for customers inside shopping.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |3     |9kWrrhi18N3YzG0fgMf3MA|\n",

I have gotten the beef schwarma plate and the chicken and gyro plate. Both arrived piping hot, delicious and the portion sizes are generous. I look forward to actually going in to eat here once things settle down more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |7     |qcf3A5mtPntTmmSfADo6tg|\n",

Especially appetizers, drinks and desserts. Services here are always amazing, especially their waitress Ling Ling. My husband  is a bloody mary  and bacon connoisseur and he loves thier bloody Mary with jalapeno vodka and extra crispy thick bacon. I am a baker myself, their desserts  are probably  one of the best desert I have ever had in my life time. Make sure you order their banana milk shake and toffee cake. They are life changing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |0     |fG_4K9BKdkUjIUReAZZwgw|\n",

They have the tables separated for social distancing with limited capacity. We joined the waiting list on Yelp and walked to the restaurant from our hotel. When we arrived our table was ready.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |1     |VlGmLO-xZrUpad3e-DLNZg|\n",

I'm being serious... I don't care how hot it is, I can always go for a good coffee. I lived in Seattle, a cold city (the capital of artisan coffee) for several years and didn't become a coffee drinker until I moved to Tampa, a hot city...go figure. Coffee love is quite serious here though.\\n\\nAnyhow, I had a cortado from Foundation Coffee on a beautiful warm Tampa day. It was smaller than other cortados that I've had (It's the size of a Cuban cortadito). The coffee was just the right amount of pick me up after eating that I needed to hang with family (my side and in-laws...kids included) for 3 more hours at the overcrowded wharf.\\n\\nThere are only a few drinks on the menu. They only carry 3 basic Torani syrups so you can't get extra fancy with flavors. However the coffee is fancy enough. Be prepared to wait. They take their time with it as they should.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |12    |vALpp2IgoeeyiRoH1qRMuQ|\n",

Bad customer service and attitude didn't help or make it pleasant at all. Just wants to get as many people in the door to make more money. Pushed me into scheduling an appointment and charged my credit card without  me showing up or my knowledge or mentioning it. Imagine being at work at seeing a charge you didn't authorize.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |1     |5Xl4YAM1efwwL2uMZawNgg|\n",

We had brunch here for the first time.  The hostess wasn't very nice but our waitress was great!  The bagel sandwiches were delicious and I loved my cappuccino.  Will definitely go back! I also should add they took covid precautions but weren't great at enforcing them with the customers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |0     |M9paBwz8HLIyVOcZM681ng|\n",

From service to culinary execution, Nesso just gets it right.\\n\\nI had the pleasure of sampling from a plethora of the Antipasti: burschetta, polpo (octopus), prosciutto plate, prugne secche (prosciutto-wrapped prunes), carciofi (artichoke), and insalata. The presentation of the dishes was stunning and the flavor didn't disappoint, either. While none of the dishes were less than amazing, there were definitely a couple standouts. The apple butter aioli on the prosciutto plate really brought it to life (and I'm already a sucker for prosciutto). The bruschetta (white bean, grana padano, wild mushroom, mustard green, tomato pomodoro) was absolutely incredible as well.\\n\\nFor my main course, I went with the Mezzaluna (ricotta, pumpkin, amaretti, speck, apple jam, spiced mascarpone). This dish was shear perfection. the hint of pumpkin and the spiced mascarpone made each bite a moment of pure bliss. The dish was perfectly sized and I was completely content (well, until I was offered dessert, at least...).\\n\\nThe tiramisu....ohhhhh, the tiramisu. This was one of those \"almost-too-pretty-to-eat\" dishes until I sank my spoon into it and then inhaled it. After plenty of food, this dish is the perfect size to share and the flavors were fantastic. Sometimes the brandy + coffee flavors of tiramisu can be overpowering... not at Nesso... They got it just right.\\n\\nThis review wouldn't be complete without giving a shoutout to our server, Jared who was a total rockstar. Jared spouted of details of the menu seamlessly, it was clear he was well-read on the menu and could help guide you to the best choice for yourself. Our glasses were never empty and the service was quick and efficient. The genuine warm vibes from the staff emulate the kind of service that many restaurants try to achieve, but few reach.

I like spicy stuff and the Level 3 was plenty spicy. I may put on my big boy pants and try the level 4 or 5 next time. I added the scoop of slaw which was a perfect contrast with the heat, while adding even more flavor. High quality brioche bun as well! On a side note... the cheese curds made a nice little side dish. Worth the drive wherever you live or work, as there's nothing comparable in STL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |0     |sRG2GmKu4CYq5M7IgmDp5Q|\n",

The family has gone here for years but it was my first experience yesterday.  Everybody agreed that it was not a good experience.  1) service was very slow. 1 hour and 45 minutes for a meal 2) Server never asked if we wanted a second glass of wine or more of anything to drink 3) They were \"sold out\" of tamales which we highly doubt as it was the same thing the last time my MIL came.  If you don't have them, say we don't have them, don't lie and say they sold out at lunch.  The server had a hard time with that lie 4) The beans and rice were cold and hard on top.  It looked like they had been put on the plate and then left until the other food added. 5) My MIL asked for melted cheese on her beans, she got the dry cotija cheese which she does not like 6) MIL and myself got the beef enchilada.  Meat was not flavored at all.  Tasted like boiled chuck roast and there was so little sauce that we couldn't taste it. 7) I got the 3 enchilada plate and the spinach enchilada was tasty but again, so little sauce to be none and the same for the chicken one of the trio.  The chicken was mixed with some kind of sauce but couldn't eat the tortilla on either the beef or chicken because it was so dry. Unfortunately, the consensus was that it was a waste of time and money and it would be a long time before we come back, if ever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |0     |egapZf476KFMG5NG-yJiEw|\n",

But like good ice cream. It's not nearly as rich or creamy as you might expect from custard, but it still hits in the heat of the summer. The darling walk up window and outdoor seating make for a nice summer outing to cool off, but I have to say this wouldn't be my first pick when it comes to an ice cream spot around town.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |0     |QKg3ZZ-gGccGNKnKIiw9vA|\n",

I always get in no problem which is so important when you're in pain!! I have a very physical job, so many times I've hobbled in and Doc straightens me up and I can walk out!! They have been my go to for pain relief or over 8 years!! \\nI started coming here after a car accident and they went above and beyond to help fix me up and I always feel like I'm visiting friends who are truly concerned about me! \\n If you need a great chiropractor and have had bad experiences in the past, those days would be over the minute you walk in the front door!! I also have to mention the massage chairs in the waiting room... I mean seriously, the best!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |1     |-jlP1Phf8A5N2TiAXZYNFg|\n",

The tacos are terrible, the only decent item is the margaritas, but even those aren't amazing. This is a good location, mediocre food.

I just needed my hair washed and friend since I had a minor surgery and can't wash my own hair for several days. The signage says $25 basically for wash/ blow dry / style. I was charge $35, I asked why and it's because my hair is shoulder length. It's exactly the length the lady explained if it's $25 or $35, it's not \"long\". Additionally I asked how much is an eyebrow wax for just the middle, $10! Every other salon charged $5-7 because it's literally 1/2 a square inch of wax... so $35 + tip to wash my hair? This isn't a high end Rittenhouse salon! And rude stylist - and they were late!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |0     |2nFUGy2fsvpR0WGTWfxQmQ|\n",

We were kept waiting at the check in desk by staff chatting about \"their plans\" after work. I helped my grandmother find a place to sit while they finished their \"important conversation\". On the way home my grandmother expressed concern that the technician with a bun spoke down to her; He was arrogant. She said she felt terrible about herself. Why would you have someone on your staff who would  speak to the elderly in such a manner?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |0     |5t9eWMS11-qENO1af5NMeg|\n",

This place is far better than any commercial franchise you probably frequent for breakfast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |0     |nnYxZ7cG6sWB89utb1f-Ig|\n",

I bought a new car that they said a salesman was using a demo car had about 400 miles on it. Salesman waits till we are going over the car to tell us that the other salesman who was driving the car bump a pole in the parking lot and it chipped some paint on front car. But they had repaired it . We examined it and it had no signs of damage. Then he says I need you to sign this paper that I told you about the repaired damage. Ok signed it. Fast forward time to trade in and we come to find out that BUMP deployed airbags and front end damage. Called dealer and was told you signed paper saying you knew of damage!! WHAT!!!!!! Now my SINGLE mom on a fixed income who bought a car from them a year ago brand new( against my advice) had to take her car in due to air conditioning not working. When she called to make the appointment the service guy told her a story about a lady who once had a rock hit under her car and damage the air conditioner( so it wasn't covered under warranty) low and behold after trying to reach the service department Guess what the same thing was wrong with my moms brand new car and not covered under warranty. Went to pick up car refused service only to find the service mechanic made no notes as what was wrong with the car. Called manager several times and left messages. No return calls . And the receptionist was extremely rude. HEY MASON @ SUNTRUP CALL YOUR CUSTOMERS BACK!!! I buy a new car every 2 years I WILL NEVER EVER BUY A CAR FROM SUNTRUP AGAIN !!!!! Horrible customer service!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |0     |2cdm3SSh5KU-Ri4jba0qeg|\n",

With Covid restrictions easing off, and friends and I all vaccinated, we gave it a try for lunch today. Wanting to say something positive, the outdoor dining space is lovely. Beyond that, nothing was good about my two friends' and my meals. Service was poor, with several other tables seated way after us being tended to before we ever saw a waitress. I ordered a BLT. It had at most 3 rather small slices of bacon on it. The tomato confit was bland, and the shredded lettuce out of a bag. Unfortunately, it was also grilled in butter, something not mentioned on the menu and which I cannot eat. I take some responsibility in not asking, but every other BLT I've ever ordered was toasted, not grilled. My friend had a beet salad, which she said was quite good and she absolutely finished it. Two problems. Despite being told it came with mixed greens, you would have needed a microscope to find them.  The waitress had explained there was both a yogurt smear and lemon vinaigrette. My friend was very explicit in asking that the dressings be on the side. Neither was. My other friend had a burger which she asked for medium. It was rare; actually raw in the middle. The manager was polite and did remove the charge for my meal. But we left very disappointed and it's definitely off the list for outings. Very sad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |0     |CmHkRYIsAl1VUD5iukiA9A|\n",

Johnny Robinson here at High Deseret will take you under his wing and show you what you NEED not necessarily what you want. I thought I would fit well on a sportster, Johnny took a hard 5 second look at me and already imagined me on a fat boy. The man knows his stuff very well! And they absolutely make sure you're taken care of and 100% pleased with every step of the process! Thank you so much High Desert!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |0     |Ye8at-0iIRQsfOw-YmZW_Q|\n",

Not only is it the coziest vibe with the beautiful string lights and ivy, but the food was absolutely incredible, the service was perfection, and the drinks were fabulous too. Rob was our waiter and we just loved him, he's great. Make sure you book a reservation in advance, it's a must here. \\n\\nI had the local drink & the pear drink - the pear drink was out of this world delicious and unique. LOVED it! \\n\\nFor our starters we ordered the calamari and the grilled romaine salad, both were SO good and we loved it. Each table comes with fresh baked bread and butter with pink salt sprinkled on top, which we're both great too! \\n\\nThree of us each ordered different entrees: one was the black spaghetti with clams (one of our favorites!), the roasted chicken with mushroom risotto & the braised short ribs with whipped potato and arugula. We all loved every single bite, definitely though the spaghetti and short ribs were the winners. \\n\\nFor dessert we ordered the creme brûlée which was delicious & was a hit with everyone! \\n\\nOverall, 10/10 meal and we will 100% be back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |2     |NAKsmteK4GlKW9v-827GKw|\n",

We love their pizza, which is consistently excellent, and the service is first rate. I generally buy an XL so we have plenty to take home. It's really that good. The patio is covered and dog friendly which is perfect for us in the summer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |0     |e5Bv5cdJrDm9DDHuw12t-A|\n",

I thought to myself, wow, can they really be THAT good? I decided to book with them and find out for myself and let me tell you, yes, they are THAT good! \\nThe moment we walked into the (clean, bright, beautifully decorated) office, we were greeted by not just one of the nicest people ever, but four of them! Seriously, everyone made us feel welcome and comfortable right off the bat, like the feeling you get being around your warmest family members and friends. Our kiddos were instantly put at ease, as was my apprehension of being solo at dental appointments for 20-month and 3-year-old boys. \\nThe cleaning was extremely thorough for such young ages and our boys didn't mind one bit! Afterwards, Dr. Alford gave them a full exam and again, they had no problems getting back into the chair. She gave me very detailed information about both of their mouths and had very helpful tips on how to get the best brush and floss on their teeth. \\nThe boys were able to pick some rewards from the office for a job well done and came home grinning from ear to ear with their sparkling teeth!\\nI booked their follow up and also an initial for myself and am so grateful to have found this wonderful team and also for the reviewers in the past who helped guide us here!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |0     |VXxg0Sl0wTl5uVHHl-7DkQ|\n",

The technician slightly made the situation seem small although it was frustrating to me. Took him about 20 minutes to let me know that there were roots within the system that could possibly be the problem while stating they were small as if they couldn't possibly be the problem. However, I figured, what do I have to lose other than $230 to get them cut down. Fortunately, the roots were indeed the problem as it has rained numerous times and the rain hasn't had any effect on my basement since.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |1     |06b-PPLyFFzcdnyneapARQ|\n",

I have been to several vet hospitals in our area, and used to work at one, so my standards are high (sorry not sorry). Our pets (we) have seen Dr. Cassie (has since moved), Dr. Champagne, Dr. Ditsworth, and most recently, Dr. Sherman. Dr. Sherman is a new doctor (~2 months) at KRPH and is amazing! I was a little nervous to see a new vet, because our elderly dog has several health issues going on, and we lost our cat unexpectedly a few days prior to the appointment. So, I was a bit of a wreck going in. To my relief, Dr. Sherman was thorough, answered all of my questions, and didn't pressure me to purchase anything. Instead, she gave options of what to do, and left it up to me to decide. She didn't rush the appointment, either, which I really appreciated. Thanks so much, Dr. Sherman.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |1     |qaY7oEFL7vuTMpPSjzDiQw|\n",

He fixed two leaky sinks (two different reasons for leaking though) in less than 1 hour. His prices were very fair and he explained each problem in a way that made me trust what he was doing. I have found my plumber!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |5     |M67YKAcFxK7dlxKLEdtDag|\n",

We have previously dined at the Haddonfield location and the Lindenwold spot, and always excellent.   \\nDue to extenuating circumstances, I was in \"crunch time\" to try and organize something for my wife's birthday (40th), and Chef Marcus came to the rescue!  \\nWe've dined here multiple times, but now for a large party and short notice, it was handled with class.  \\nThis place is so good there's never an empty seat and never less than 10-15 people waiting outside.

Usually I will leave them some tips but 15% is a little bit too much for a TOGO order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |0     |oJXXdrupdeUvidTwIUgPPA|\n",

Well as I was even attempting to peel the shrimp they would just disintegrate in my hand and turn to mush... only decent thing I had here was the oysters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |0     |7SEuhwCMaDm_AtKwPDgjsQ|\n",

As far as the food, We got our food an hour later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |0     |fXEK2vSmgtMWxQwMD7_Luw|\n",

There's a BW-3's in the mall and there are a few other smaller food court type options for food too. The place is absolutely crawling with security, including real police officers. \\n\\nSimon has worked really hard with the community to bring this area back from the brink. A few short years ago, the mall was almost totally vacant. Now there are a variety of small shops like Bath and Body Works, Finish Line, and Claire's, a movie theater, several churches which call the mall home, and even a \"shop\" that is dedicated to rehoming animals: ReTails. These animals are strays and owner surrenders which come in on Friday night and stay until Sunday night, hoping for new homes. The adoption fees are very affordable and ReTails is run entirely by volunteers. How cool is that? This is a lower income area. Shoppers don't need to be sucked into financing puppy mill pups by typical mall pet stores. Check ReTails out next time you're looking for a dog. The weekend I found a home for Rags (the FIV+ stray cat I had been feeding), there were many purebred dogs: chihuahua, dachshund, shih-tzu, as well as an adorable black and brindle tripod (3 legs) who was wagging his tail and playing with a ball. Kittens are $40, cats $25, and a 2nd friend is only $20. \\n\\nWould I go hang out here? No. But I used to do all my Target shopping here when I lived in Irvington. And ReTails is awesome!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |5     |-THLGnsYKu3yQAsy_tt1fw|\n",

I'm from Cali, so I know Mexican food, and had low expectations for Cantina Feliz in a small town 30 miles north of Philly airport.  But I was delighted with the night.  Turns out, I didn't have to compare it to what we have, this was modern Mexi.\\n\\n7 of us.  Celebrated a successful launch after many months of preparing.  We walked into, what appeared to be a house re-constructed into a restaurants with many small to medium-sized rooms.  Lovely.  Margaritas, chips and salsa, were abound.\\n\\nFor the table, we tried various items:\\n=============================\\n1.  Chips and Salsa [$free, 4.5 stars] -- Wonderfully thin and crisp, and not oily.\\n\\n2/3.  Fig & Bacon Quac [$15.95, 5.0 stars] and Buffalo Chicken Quac [$15.95, 4.0 stars].  Huh?  Yep, you read right.  Pricey, but nice portion.  They have the standard stuff, too, but why?  So good!\\n\\n4.  Grilled Octopus [$10.95, 5.0 stars] -- citrus-y and smokey, amazing flavor and perfectly cooked.\\n\\nMy entree:\\n=========\\n5.  Carne Tampiquena [$21.95, 5.0 stars] -- flank steak, chicken enchiladas, refried beans, red rice, traditional guacamole, pico de gallo.  Sliced lean steak, perfectly seasoned, nice portion.  The enchilada, rice and beans, were spot on.  Frankly, this dish could not be better.\\n\\nOverall:\\n=========\\nIn was fun, and totally delish.  Service was terrific, place is beautiful, noise-level was perfect -- just enough to create a vibe.  Good night indeed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |20    |ZIOCmdFaMIF56FR-nWr_2A|\n",

My overall reaction to our stay was that the hotel was a bit overpriced for the level of comfort and service. Mom has some difficulty walking, and our room was very narrow--not much room between the beds and dresser.  The transport chair was a tight fit, as was her walker. Also, the curved desk and dresser top  surfaces may be a fashion statement, but from a practicality standpoint, they are awful.  Lots of stuff hit the floor. The beds are high, and difficult for an older person to get into. The armchair has no footstool--that's an amenity even I appreciate, as I don't want to sit on the bed but like to put my feet up. Also--no nightlight in the bathroom. This is a must for anybody over 40. Finally, one of my pet peeves is A/C that blows on the bed--this room had that problem.\\n\\nOn the plus side, the room and bath were spotlessly clean, the beds very comfortable, and the room extremely quiet. Although several families with happy and boisterous kids were staying on our floor, we could not hear them once the door was closed. The pocket door on the bathroom saved space and never obstructs traffic in the room.  The main lobby and room were wheelchair accessible, even though the room wasn't labeled that way. The staff was friendly and helpful, especially the housekeeper on our floor (3rd floor, June 3-5), who helped me with doors and luggage, and who NEVER knocked and asked about cleaning the room. The coffee bar had good coffee and good service. Parking was a bit oddly located, but plentiful and FREE--a huge plus for an urban hotel, and Philly parking prices are high. Internet/WiFi are also free--very nice! \\n\\nOverall, it was a very comfortable stay, one that I would rate as worth about $180/night instead of the $240 I paid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |1     |2i_9H0jZoj5NkMcwT5h2CQ|\n",

This place is overall just really fun to go to on a weekend!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |0     |JPrswXdr3EUmZJCYtUBa5Q|\n",

We came here for a birthday dinner and the strawberry shortcake was the best I have ever had.\\n\\nOyster shooters weren't chilled enough. Don't bother with them.  Also stay away from the Louisiana gumbo. You are not in Louisiana. Do have any of the seafood entrees. Lots to choose from and you can't go wrong there, especially with the shellfish items.\\nThe Seafood Extravagana is just that. Yummy lobster, crab, scallops, shrimp on spiced saffron rice in a white wine reduction.

Additionally - I heard 2 other customers complain about their orders being wrong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |1     |cLy_dyDNhQSzUfGuKUHbbQ|\n",

But after visiting a different place, I realized I was definitely not suppose to be bleeding or bruised after a wax. Staff was super kind but the waxing was done poorly and was so painful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |0     |la8JfD0xw3Ukvqf9VhT91A|\n",

If someone can help - seriously - please message me, because this one ain't it.  Yes, I know \"ain't\" isn't a word; much like Asian Grill isn't clean, or particularly good.  \\n\\nI'm actually tiring of writing reviews for bad Chinese restaurants; I feel like I'm typing the same things over and over, and am kind of at the point where I want to say \"the food is shite\", and move on.  Sadly, that isn't who I am.\\n\\nSo, o.k., the shrimp toast is good.  If I stopped here, we'd be at four stars.  It comes as a sizeable portion, albeit in the bizarre format of three pieces, horizontally sliced, that are heavy on filling and light on bread.  It isn't saturated with oil, and is totally par for the course.  Egg rolls are pretty much the same everywhere, and to possibly channel Yogi Berra, so are these.  I'll include a mention of the sweet and sour chicken here as well, since all of the above is basically fried junk food, and that was fine, too.  The sweet and sour sauce doesn't have much going on in the sour department, but it very rarely does, wherever you go.\\n\\nActual Food Not Involving Fryolator: \\n\\nThe fried rice is yellow, and if you read my reviews, you will know I think yellow fried rice is inferior.  While there are exceptions, this is not one.  For starters, there is no egg, which is JUST FUCKING BAFFLING to me.  Also, infuriating, if you couldn't tell.  I've had both the chicken and pork iterations, and I do prefer the chicken; the char siu here is almost completely devoid of flavor.  I say \"almost\" because, in the most recent instance, it tasted like it had been sitting in the fridge for two days.  And you know what they say - there's no pork like old pork.  Do they say that?  If they do, it's only because it's nasty.\\n\\nThe pork lo mein is made with the same pork as above, only cut longer.  This one didn't taste slightly turned or like smelly refrigerator, but like anything at all.  If there were such a thing as stringy tofu, it could have been that.  There are almost no vegetables in this dish: a miniscule amount of nearly evaporated sprouts, three pieces of either scallion or garlic chive in the entire quart, and a small number of celery slivers. That was it.  Not even a lonely canned water chestnut.  Also, it was overcooked, so the noodles were too soft.  If I may borrow one of yours, I would like to give this three thumbs down.\\n\\nThe hot and spicy beef, warm and not particularly spicy, has a sauce that is mainly ketchup.  Yes, actual ketchup; if I had to guess, Heinz.  I'll just end this one here.  Anything more would be a superfluous addition of insult to injury.\\n\\nThe General Tso's chicken was not even a little spicy, but otherwise what it should be.  In other words, edible, but probably not what you're expecting.  This could be repaired by knowing in advance, and telling them not to forget the peppers.  Assuming they have them, that is.\\n\\nWhat else?  I might have blocked some of it out.  Oh, yes - I also ordered hot and sour soup here once.  Again, not very hot, but a little sour, and full of what I think were sliced button mushrooms, as opposed to shiitake and wood ear.  Edible, but wrong.  I don't recall seeing any pork in there either, come to think of it, but maybe that's just as well.\\n\\nAll in all, first impressions at Asian Grill are correct.  You walk in, it looks bad, and it's not great.  I'd say to go with your gut on this one, and if not, trust your eyeballs.|5     |ZtKll2ySQfGftaXqAFe8Zg|\n",

The final product was great, but the path to getting it was unexpected. \\n\\nBased off the positive reviews, I brought five+ pieces in for tailoring. The tailor was nice and seemed to have a great rapport with the bride who was in getting her dress fitted. \\n\\nI was told my items would be ready March 1, to call before coming in to pick up, and to bring cash. \\n\\nI received a voicemail that weekend that my items would now be ready March 5. I wasn't in a rush, so that was fine. On March 5, I called the number that the voicemail had been left with. The tailor answered, but didn't say AK Tailor - this happens sometimes, so I asked if this was AK Tailor. I was told yes. I then said my name and that I was calling to find out if I could pick up my items. The tailor got very upset and started asking who I was and how I got this number. I was so confused, since I was just returning the call to the number that had called me. Turns out the voicemail had been left via her cell phone. Once this was figured out, it was fine, but it was pretty intense initially. Regardless, my items were not ready. I was told to call back March 7.\\n\\nI called back March 7 and my items were again not ready. They were ready March 8 - one week after the initial date given.\\n\\nAgain, I do want to say that the completed work was done very well, but with the process to get my items, I think I have to continue looking for a local tailor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |12    |ow1YVonkr8G-8kFUKo-bJg|\n",

I called at 4:28 and according to my GPS I would arrive at their location on Chinden in seven minutes.  Shelby told me that she could get me in at 4:30 I said I'm about seven minutes away I arrived at 4:39 as I walked in the door and Shelby said sorry I'm gonna have to cancel your appointment because once it hits nine minutes we have to reschedule. She was inflexible she didn't care about service and she had a horrible attitude as soon as I let her know that I was recording the conversation all the sudden her attitude changed and she explained the policy and explained why she had to reschedule. In all my years of going there I've never had a time where I was late however I've had several times where I had to wait past nine minutes and they didn't do anything to make up for it. I asked for the manager and she got more attitude and told me that the manager wasn't in and I'd have to just wait until she contacted me. Shelby then sits there while I'm waiting for my appointment and types and types and types that she sending something to the manager this has been the worst experience and then I had to go in and get my nose waxed while I am fuming about Shelby's horrible attitude. I still paid full price I still got my wax and I was still polite to the person that did the wax and gave her a tip however Shelby needs to go bye-bye. I also have a recording where you can hear sure Shelby talk about policy policy policy that I've never had to use I've never had explain to me and I arrive right as it changes to nine minutes completely ridiculous get a clue about customer service Shelby. She certainly doesn't want to continue to have good customers and continue to get a paycheck.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |0     |03U9SKgHEQg6mg4sSh21WQ|\n",

We were traveling from Atlanta GA and so used to diversity and quality of food culture.  So when we arrived in Hudson FL, we were a bit disappointed by  lack of food culture over there.  But the disappointment was gone after we discovered this place.  We mostly fell in love with the quality of sushi here.  And I'm japanese from Japan so I think I know a thing or two about sushi.  First they are very inexpensive compared to sushi restaurants in Atlanta GA. But the quality is better than some in Atlanta GA.  My son who used to only eat salmon sushi started to eat hamachi and eel after we went here.  We stayed in Hudson FL for a week and we kept going back to Rooster Thai Sushi for 5 days.  Only downside is this place is so small literally a hole in a wall that sometimes they close down online ordering early for the kitchen to catch up with the orders.  I don't want them to change though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |0     |akrb9w9PNn0t8njgkMKdBg|\n",

They could honestly double the price of each dish and it would still be absolutely worth it. Cho Thai is a serious contender for the best Thai food in the GNO.\\n\\nI also appreciated that all of the staff was wearing masks, and that they offered a no-touch payment option.

Friendly servers delivering great Nola creole cuisine. I again had to order the incredibly delicious shrimp and grits that offers the best of plump juicy shrimp in a creamy tasty bed of grits that complement each other so well. We shared some green strawberries for dessert that was really special.

I have asthma AND and auto immune condition and the fact that DeAnna the manager not only took the side of the woman compromising my wellness, she also walked right up to my face and proceeded to touch ALL OF MY ITEMS that she refused to take back with UNSANITIZED hands. She even allowed one cashier to finish the rude ladies transaction which was a purchase and refused to allow me to be refunded. I had to go to another location and come in contact with double the amount of people just to get my money back that i needed to ensure i can EAT for the next 30 - 180 days as opposed to having obsolete clothing items. The pandemic is temporary but you all have permanently lost a customer because of DeAnnas poor conflict resolution/de escalation skills, and failure as a company representative to comply with government requirements and keep vulnerable customers safe and virus free                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |1     |n0rMSs0NHqQKreAr58tbCA|\n",

Everything about it is just a little bit gross; from the beer tap and daiquiri machine at the front desk to the overworked hotel staff. Nothing about this place exudes the opulence I've come to associate with visiting this area. It's an older hotel that's been updated, but it's decorated in Mardi gras purple, green and gold. Even though this has been my least favorite hotel experience in the New Orleans french quarter; this could be a good place for the price, but only if you're in town to party, and willing to drink until you can't hear the street cars constantly rolling by.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |1     |kJJn_EGXRJHIeJIcl6NxSw|\n",

I have tried many items on the menu ad have never been disappointed.  Even had them do the catering for my engagement party and everyone complimented the food.  Buffalo Chicken Cheese Steak is one of my regulars and i think its one of the best around.

You can grab their beach cruisers to explore too!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |0     |hV1HCAon9sBS3CgsXYwMgw|\n",

Our experience on the restaurant-side has been pretty good as well.  There are huge TVs everywhere, but the booths have decent-sized cushions which gives you a cozy, personal feel.  The crab fries with cheese are amazing, as are the sweet potato fries with sweet sauce.  I usually get a cheesesteak, burger, or something similar.  The wait staff have always done a good job for us, even on busy nights during football games.  We also have never waited more than a minute or two for a table to open up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |0     |_H0B-Fc8G6ClFoKqBsklUQ|\n",

They call and ask for general information \"Who is the warehouse manager?\" or \"What is the buyer's name?\" and that's it.  Then they send a \"newsletter\" (a very expensive one that they then try to bill you for $295) addressed to whatever name you gave them and they say that that person ordered the newsletter. Not just for them, but for anyone calling - if you aren't sure it's a legit question, give them a fake name of the 'buyer' or 'Production Manager'.  I like funny names like, \"Rocky Sands\" or \"Woody Pines\" or \"Sandy Beech\"  - I have a list of them.  Then, when a newsletter comes addressed to those people, write in big black magic marker all across the front of it (so they can't use it again) \"REFUSED! No such person! Return to Sender.\" When they call and try to argue that that person ordered their publication, you can feel free to laugh at them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |9     |wf2dETPPcCKDoUiuPp-4Ew|\n",

They are pretty fabulous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |0     |lEgiSAvHm1CQWAQMDNZ-qA|\n",

I come on way under the 3 rooms +hallway. I asked if they could add a freshener ( which I paid for). The guys were nice enough, but my carpet looked more dingy and didn't smell fresh and clean, even after I paid the extra. It was as if they used someone else's dirty carpet water to clean mine, and mine wasn't bad. I just have to have it cleaned every 12 months to maintain the warranty on my beautiful carpet. But, it looks/smells worse than it did before they cleaned it. I vacuum frequently because I love this carpeting and want to keep it nice. And I felt it was dirtier overall than before they came and got the upgraded service from me. I think I'll call someone else next time. They used to be a great carpet cleaning company. But this last time around (4/01/2019), not so much.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |2     |1_JAW2U81MHtg-VyOTTiCg|\n",

We were provided with both menus, which was really nice because two of us wanted breakfast and two lunch!\\n\\nAll the food was very fresh and had plenty of gluten free options!  They make their own jams, which are available for purchase.\\n\\nI opted for the Cuban panini, which had excellent flavor.  The breakfasts really looked delicious so I would definitely go that route on a future visit.\\n\\nEveryone was very friendly, helpful and attentive.  Being winter, sitting outside wasn't an option but the patio outside was cute.  I'd love to visit in spring or summer!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |2     |kpgNieiazFGZaEDhxLOJUg|\n",

Also try the pizza!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |0     |7a3Ebt6Jjp8Mys-3nLD79w|\n",

My pulled pork sammie was awesome and my boyfriend said his brisket sandwich was delicious. It's a casual place- we just sat outside on the picnic tables. But if you are craving bbq comfort food, you won't be disappointed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |0     |IYD8kuy0mQMrbgpqo9QGPg|\n",
